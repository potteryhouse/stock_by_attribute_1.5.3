stock_by_attribute_1.5.3
========================

Stock by Attribute (SBA) for Zen Cart 1.5.1

This plugin has been merged with the changes necessary to work on other multiple versions of ZC.  The work that has been completed there
has not been back ported to here as maintaining multiple versions of the same software where the differences are pretty much only the
template override files or in the few modified core files.  That location is: https://github.com/mc12345678/Stock_By_Attributes_Combined.


This SBA Modification will only work with Zen Cart 1.5.1.
This is due to the functionality and code changes that have been added to support this version of Zen Cart.
